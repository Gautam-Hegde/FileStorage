# Decentralized storage - where privacy meets convenience


FileStorage is a decentralized file storage application that allows users to securely and privately store their files. Using a custom smart contract, the app is deployed on the Polygon Mumbai Testnet, ensuring that the data is immutable and tamper-proof.


## Featuresâœ”
- Uses Web3.storage and IPFS (Interplanetary File System), a peer-to-peer protocol, to ensure that the files are stored in a distributed manner, making it resistant to downtime and censorship.
- Built with ReactJS, making it easy for users to upload, manage, and share their files.
- User-friendly and intuitive interface, making it accessible to users of all technical skill levels


## InstallationðŸ˜Ž

1. Clone the repository
```bash

```
## Smart Contract ExplainedðŸš€
- We have 7 parameters that we want to save, **fileId** will be the serial number that weâ€™ll be counting based on the number of files created, **FileHash** is basically the IPFS hash/CID which is used to identify our file on IPFS network, weâ€™ll get this hash when we upload our file to IPFS
- Next is **FileSize, FileType** and **FileName** which weâ€™ll get from javascript when we upload the file using the input box. 
- **UploadTime** is the time when file was uploaded and **Uploader** is the address which uploaded the file.
